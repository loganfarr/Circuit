The requirements were: different backgrounds for each page, an off-center wrapper, music player, list of news articles and upcoming performances, and a login system with different user roles. The client provided me designs in PSDs, and I cut them up and turned them into a sub-theme of Adaptive Theme.\u00a0\nNote: The link is to the dev URL I built it on, as opposed to the live site. I turned it over to the client in a zip file, and I am not sure where it went from there.\n"}]}
