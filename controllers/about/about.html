	<h4>I am currently a student at the University of Utah, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Leadership Studies. I have five years of web development experience, with three being in professional web development positions. In my off time, I like to work in C++, specifically the OpenCV framework.</h4>

	<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Web Developer</h3>
	<hr />

	<p>I consider myself a full-stack web developer, with experience in HTML5, CSS3/SCSS/LESS, JavaScript & jQuery, PHP, SQL, and web server applications such as Nginx and Apache. My content management system (CMS) of choice is Drupal, where I have experience in all sides (front- and back-end, and site building) of the development spectrum. (I'm also a Drupal association individual member!)</p>

	<p>Currently I manage my own VPS server at Linode, and have set up multiple servers from the ground up. I am comfortable in all operating sysems (Windows, OSX, *unix).</p>

	<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Software Developer</h3>
	<hr />

	<p>My software development skills are not quite as honed, but still something that I take pride in. I started learning C# in 2010, then moved to C++ in 2011. I have also taken classes in Java. All my work in software has been for hobby-related things or for classes. </p>

	<p>With the exception of Java, all the things I have learned were self-taught with online tutorials, books, and other guides. </p>

	<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">3D Printer</h3>
	<hr />

	<p>I have built two Reprap 3D printers, and experimented with Arduino components. I learned from these projects that I am more of a software than a hardware person!</p>

	<p>Using Maya or Blender, I have designed quite a few 3D models for printing purposes. Although I would not consider myself fluent in these skills, it is something I am capable of.</p>

	<h3 style="margin-top: 1em;">Go outside!</h3>
	<hr/>

	<p>When I am not coding, I love to travel. Often times when I have a little extra cash I’ll find somewhere to travel to over the weekend and will make an adventure out of it. Or, when it's warm, I will go hiking with friends and family in the mountains of Utah.</p>

	<p>Oh, and I hate writing “About” pages for myself.</p>

	<p>If you would like a copy of my resumé, please contact me and I’ll get it over to you.</p>
